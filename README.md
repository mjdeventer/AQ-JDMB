DIY low-budget air quality monitoring  
Mattias and Julians repository for remote-collaboration on building an Air Quality Station with data collection and post-processing on Raspberry Pi. We build on sensors and code from previous projects that were mainly designed to run on microcontrollers providing a cheaper price point. This project is for users of Python3, Matplotlib, etc.

Detailed information about sensors used, interfacing, wiring, and code is provided in the repo's Wiki
